## Gross Domestic Product Analysis {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}

### Introduction

We would like to analyze Gross Domestic Product for all countries, we have two datasets,[Gross Domestic Product](http://data.worldbank.org/data-catalog/GDP-ranking-table) and [Educational](http://data.worldbank.org/data-catalog/ed-stats). To conduct our analysis, tidy data is required, therefore, we will conduct multiple steps to clean, merge and sort the data.
Data was obtained from the [World Bank](http://www.worldbank.org) website

### Libraries
Loading all necessary libraries to be utilized in our analysis
```{r}
library(bitops)
library(plyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(downloader)
library(RCurl)
library(repmis)
library(xtable)
```

### Data Load

**Download Files from the internet**

```{r}
GDPsite <- "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fdata%2FGDP.csv"
EDUCsite <- "https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fdata%2FEDSTATS_Country.csv"
download.file(GDPsite,destfile = "Data/GDP.csv")
download.file(EDUCsite,destfile = "Data/EDUC.csv")
```
Both files are downloaded into the data folder

**Read CSV files downloaded in the data folder**

```{r}
# Loading GDP Data and load only the lines that correspond with a ranked country
# We are also changing the column labels and removing unwanted columns
GDP <- read.csv ("Data/GDP.csv",sep = ",",header = FALSE, skip=5,nrows = 190,col.names = c("CountryCode","Ranking","Blank","Economy","CountryGDP","V6","V7","V8","V9","V10"))
GDP[6:10] <- NULL
GDP[3] <- NULL

# Loading Education Data and Loading only fields required by our analysis
Educ <- read.csv("Data/EDUC.csv",sep = ",",header = TRUE)
Educ <- Educ[c(1,3)]
```

```{r}
# Changing the format of our CountryGDP and Ranking to be able to sort them later
GDP$CountryGDP <- as.numeric(gsub("[^[:digit:]]","", GDP$CountryGDP))
GDP$Ranking <- as.numeric(gsub("[^[:digit:]]","", GDP$Ranking))
```
### Merge and Sort
```{r}
# Merging Data sets by short country code
GDPandEDUC <- merge(Educ, GDP, by = "CountryCode")

# Sorting data in Ascending order by dollars
GDPandEDUCSorted <- GDPandEDUC[order(GDPandEDUC$CountryGDP, decreasing = FALSE),]
```


### Analysis #1 #2 #3

#### 1- How many of the IDs match?
```{r results = "asis"}
print(paste0("ID's in both tables: ",length(intersect(GDP$CountryCode,Educ$CountryCode))))
```
There are 189 ID that match between both datasets

#### 2- What is the 13th country in the resulting data frame?

```{r results= "show"}
X <- GDPandEDUCSorted[13,]
knitr::kable(X,padding = 2,align = 'l')
```

The 13 Country in the dataset is St. Kitts and Nevis

#### 3- What are the average GDP rankings for the "High income: OECD" and "High income:nonOECD" groups?

```{r results = "show"}
Y <- ddply(GDPandEDUCSorted[GDPandEDUCSorted$Income.Group == "High income: nonOECD" | GDPandEDUCSorted$Income.Group == "High income: OECD",],.(Income.Group),summarize, "Average Ranking"=mean(Ranking))
knitr::kable(Y,padding = 2, align = 'l')
```

* Average Ranking for High Income nonOECD Countries:  91.91
* Average Ranking for High Income OECD Countries:     32.96

### Analysis #4 #5
#### 4- Plot the GDP for all of the countries. Use ggplot2 to color your plot by Income Group
##### Creating a scatter plot with all countries, grouped by Income Group
```{r include=TRUE}
P <- ggplot(GDPandEDUCSorted)+ geom_point(aes(x=CountryGDP,y=Income.Group,colour=Income.Group))+scale_x_log10()+labs(x = GDPandEDUCSorted$CountryGDP)
P
```
